# RetinalAbnormalityDetection

This project is a way to identify individuals with diseased eyes based off of a retinal scan. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network to accomplish this.

## AnomalyDetectorActual.py
This file is the final version of the attempted CNN models that performed the best out of all my attempts from AnomalyDetectorAttempts.py

## AnomalyDetectorAttempts.py
This file containts several attempted model architectures that were attempted

## Autoencoder.py
This file is an unfinished attempt at utilizing an autoencoder in a non conventional way to train on only the normal healthy retinal scan data, so that it compresses and expands data poorly on diseased retinal scans since they are abnormal and look different than what the model was originally trained on
